# IHaveADream

Before the summer of 9th grade, I started to learn how to program.

My first ever programming project using blocks on MIT App Inventor.

I bought a book called "App Inventor 2: Creating your own Android Apps" (as shown below)

I followed the book, doing as many of the projects I can. 

This is the first of many projects, a milestone for me even though this is a simplistic project.

All it does is play a recording of Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech when you click his image.
