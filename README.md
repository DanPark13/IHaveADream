# IHaveADream

Before the summer of 9th grade, I started to learn how to program.

Since I knew I wanted to make apps, I started programming with blocks on MIT App Inventor to learn about basic coding structure and sequences.

I bought a book called "App Inventor 2: Creating your own Android Apps" (as shown below)

I followed the book, doing as many of the projects I can. 

This is the first of many projects, a milestone for me even though this is a simplistic project.

All it does is play a recording of Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech when you click his image.

Even though it is a basic project, I decided to highlight this project as it was the first completed program I have ever done.
